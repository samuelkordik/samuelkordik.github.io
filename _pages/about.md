### Who Am I?
I love to find answers to questions and solutions to problems, and to teach others to do the same. I am passionate about emergency medical services, and my professional mission is to drive forward the quality of out-of-hospital emergency medical care, with a particular emphasis on building up paramedicine as a profession, encouraging the transition of paramedics from technicians to clinicians, and encourage the adoption of evidence-based paramedic practice.

I am currently a senior EMS leader at [Cypress Creek EMS](https://www.ccems.com), where I am responsible for our clinical quality of care, clinical research, data analysis/informatics, field training programs, clinical practice guidelines, and initial, continuing, and public education programs. I also continue to work as an educator, a Field Supervisor, ground paramedic, and as a bike team member. 

I love living life as an adventure. I am married to a wonderful woman; together, we are adoptive and foster parents, love our two oddball dogs, and raise chickens and veggies on our urban homestead. I am constantly reading and constantly striving to grow and improve.

### Why I Exist
My goal in life is to glorify God by working hard, working well, and making a genuine difference in people's lives. For me, that purpose is fulfilled personally through my marriage, family, and friendships, and professionally through seeking to advance the quality of out-of-hospital emergency medical care using my skills and passions. 

If I can help you through my skill set, please let me know.
