Today’s class—ACLS for Experienced Providers—began with a discussion of how we progress from beginners to experts. We discussed the Know–Do–Learn cycle, and the Dreyfus Model, and reflected on one of our senior supervisors and how she’s achieved a high level of expertise.

Then someone mentioned a key factor in her development—Humility. A willingness to be fallible, and be seen as fallible.

Humility in this context is the opposite of ego. It puts one’s own development, own desire to grow and be better, ahead of any desire to be seen as an expert.

How interesting is it that the pathway to being respected as an expert starts with not seeking that respect.
