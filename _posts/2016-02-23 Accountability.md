Accomplishing cultural change in our organizations is like turning a large ship: it doesn’t happen quickly and doesn’t happen easily. The key to turning the ship is consistent, effective pressure with the rudder; the same is true with the organization. Consistent, effective pressure from leaders can effect large-scale change over the long term.

Effective pressure comes from accountability. Setting expectations clearly, and then consistently holding people to those standards.
