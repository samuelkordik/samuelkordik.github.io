   abstract = {Purpose: Although trauma is the leading cause of death for the pediatric population, few studies have addressed the preventable/potentially preventable death rate (PPPDR) attributable to trauma. Methods: This is a retrospective study of trauma-related death records occurring in Harris County, Texas in 2014. Descriptive and Chi-squared tests were conducted for two groups, pediatric and adult trauma deaths in relation to demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, death location and survival time. Results: There were 105 pediatric (age < 18 years) and 1738 adult patients. The PPPDR for the pediatric group was 21.0%, whereas the PPPDR for the adult group was 37.2% (p = 0.001). Analysis showed fewer preventable/potentially preventable (P/PP) deaths resulting from any blunt trauma mechanism in the pediatric population than in the adult population (19.6% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001). Amongst the pediatric population, P/PP traumatic brain injury (TBI) were more common in the youngest age range (age 0–5) vs. the older (6–12 years) pediatric and adolescent (13–17 years) patients. Conclusion: Our results identify areas of opportunities for improving pediatric trauma care. Although the overall P/PP death rate is lower in the pediatric population than the adult, opportunities for improving initial acute care, particularly TBI, exist.},

   abstract = {Objective:To establish a trauma preventable/potentially preventable death rate (PPPDR) within a heavily populated county in Texas.Summary:The National Academies of Sciences estimated the trauma preventable death rate in the United States to be 20%, issued a call for zero preventable deaths, while acknowledging that an accurate preventable death rate was lacking. In this absence, effective strategies to improve quality of care across trauma systems will remain difficult.Methods:A retrospective review of death-related records that occurred during 2014 in Harris County, TX, a diverse population of 4.4 million. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, cause, timing, and location of deaths were assessed. Deaths were categorized using uniform criteria and recorded as preventable, potentially preventable or nonpreventable.Results:Of 1848 deaths, 85% had an autopsy and 99.7% were assigned a level of preventability, resulting in a trauma PPPDR of 36.2%. Sex, age, and race/ethnicity varied across preventability categories (P < 0.01). Of 847 prehospital deaths, 758 (89.5%) were nonpreventable. Among 89 prehospital preventable/potentially preventable (P/PP) deaths, hemorrhage accounted for 55.1%. Of the 657 initial acute care setting deaths, 292 (44.4%) were P/PP; of these, hemorrhage, sepsis, and traumatic brain injury accounted for 73.3%. Of 339 deaths occurring after initial hospitalization, 287 (84.7%) were P/PP, of these 117 resulted from sepsis and 31 from pulmonary thromboembolism, accounted for 51.6%.Conclusions:The trauma PPPDR was almost double that estimated by the National Academies of Sciences. Data regarding P/PP deaths offers opportunity to target research, prevention, intervention, and treatment corresponding to all phases of the trauma system.},

   abstract = {Background: Quality improvement (QI) for endotracheal intubation has relied primarily on written documentation. Written documentation can be fraught with errors of recall, accuracy, and falsification. Video documentation would offer a method of documenting airway management performance that is accurate and objective. By demonstrating the frequency of discrepancy between written and video documentation, we hope to reveal the improved accuracy of measurement with video documentation and thus the superior tool it would be for QI practices. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed comparing written to video documentation of endotracheal intubations using the TASER® Axon Flex© video camera. The video and written documentation were obtained as standard practice for internal QI purposes since May 2013. The videos of endotracheal intubations were reviewed by two reviewers each, who were blinded to the written documentation. A third reviewer served to break the tie when discrepancy existed. Video reviewers used independent audit tools to review the RSI videos and tabulate predetermined performance measures in a yes/no system. The recorded quality measures were then compared between the written and video documentation and any discrepancies were measured. Results: Only 15% of PCRs matched the video record. The most common reason for discrepancy between the PCR and the video record was whether the intubation took less than 45 seconds. When there was a discrepancy about whether the intubation was less than 45 seconds, the intubation was on average 187 seconds. Other notable discrepancies included whether LEMON was evaluated (42% discrepancy), total number of intubation attempts (36%), first attempt success (24%), and whether an airway introducer device was used (12%). The remainder of discrepancies appeared less than 7% of the time. Discussion: The results of the study suggest that written documentation is limited in its accuracy. This is most likely related to the high stress atmosphere, inaccurate recall and the limited nature of written documentation. Incomplete documentation can, in turn, lead to an incomplete QI process. Our study suggests that other modalities, such as the use of video recording for high stakes practices can improve the QI process, and in turn lead to better practice.},
